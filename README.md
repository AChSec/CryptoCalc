# CryptoCalc
Cryptography Calculator

An interactive tool for demonstrating and computing fundamental cryptographic techniques. Its goal is to present cryptography and cryptoanalysis concepts in a **clear and visually comprehensible way**, aimed primarily at students with some prior knowledge. 

## Features ##
**Modular implementation of crypto algorithms**, including
-	Caesar cipher
-	Columnar Transposition
-	Diffie-Hellman key exchange
-	RSA and ElGamal encryption & digital signatures
-	Zero-Knowledge Proofs
-	ECC and more
  
**Utility modules such as hash functions and MACs**

**Visual sketches and formulas to help explain each protocol**

**Additional explanations**
